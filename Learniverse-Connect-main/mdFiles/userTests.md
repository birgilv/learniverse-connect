# User Test Report: Learniverse Website


## 15th April 2024

Participants: 

- Ronja Aurora Halvorsen (age 20, gender: female)
- Marie Vangen (age 23, gender: female)

### Observations and Findings 
#### Text Size and Readability:
- Increase the text size, particularly for important elements like the login button and search page elements, to enhance readability.
- Ensure that all elements, including the currency button, are easily noticeable and accessible.


#### Mobile Responsiveness:
- Revise the styling to ensure that the website looks aesthetically pleasing and functions well on mobile devices.

##### Pagination:
- Improve the pagination feature to prevent users from navigating to empty pages.
- Implement a mechanism to disable the next button when there are no more pages or courses available.

##### Course Categories:
- Enhance the visibility of course categories on the course page. Users should be able to easily identify which categories a specific course belongs to.


##### Navigation Clarity:
- Make the navigation more intuitive by ensuring that users can easily find other pages without relying solely on the hamburger menu.

#### Currency Display:
- Consider relocating the currency display from the header to a more suitable location, such as the profile, to declutter the header and improve overall visual appeal.

##### Lazy Loading:
- Implement lazy loading to optimize the loading time and performance of the website, particularly when dealing with a large number of courses.

Participants: 

- Ronja Aurora Halvorsen (age 20, gender: female)
- Ask Iver Sylte (age 24, gender: male)

### Observations and Findings 
#### Images
- Have the iamges be consistent. For instance some images have a border and round while others have no border and sharp edges

#### Footer
- Courses at the bottom are blocked due to the footer (bug)

#### Filtering
- Filtering is too cramped

#### Other
- The user wishes to see the cheapest or lowest price of that course
- Remove unnecessary filler info in the footer and in the home page
- Currencyselector and favorites should not be placed in home page and header (this is being worked on)
- Text colour in coursecard is too light, user told that if they didnt use eye contacts then they would not be able to see what is written there, should make it darker or change to contrast to make it easier to read
- Bug when typing e in the input field when changing min -and maxprice (price becomes NaN)
- Should what error occurs when attempting to create user (does not show password needs to be 6 characters)


##### Lazy Loading:
- Happy that lazy loading has been added
- Lazy loading should not show when no courses fit the filter
